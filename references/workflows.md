# Wathba CLI — End-to-End Workflows

Always run commands with `--json` (and `--no-input` unless you specifically want a browser handoff). After every command: check the exit code, then parse the envelope, then branch on `data.outcome`. Exit 0 alone proves nothing.

## Outcome state machine

```
SETUP_NOT_REQUIRED ──────────────► activate ─► ACTIVE
setup ─► PENDING ─► READY_TO_ACTIVATE ─► activate ─► ACTIVE
   │        │
   │        ├─► ACTION_REQUIRED  (member setup page; exact `service open` next command)
   │        └─► BLOCKED          (precondition failed; hint says what)
deactivate ─► DEACTIVATION_PENDING ─► wait --until removed ─► REMOVED
```

Also check `data.canActivate` before calling `activate`.

## 0. Fresh machine → working CLI

```sh
curl -fsSL https://install.wathba.info/install.sh | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.wathba/bin:$PATH"       # persist in the user's shell profile
wathba version --json
wathba doctor --json                         # all checks should pass
```
Scripted install: `WATHBA_INSTALL_OUTPUT=json` and read the final NDJSON event's `outcome`.

## 1. Onboarding (auth + project)

```sh
wathba login --device --wait --json     # prints verification URL + user code; --wait blocks until approved
wathba auth status --json               # confirm session
wathba project create --name "my-app" --json
wathba project select <projectId> --json
```
- `project select` re-reads the project and persists its backend default
  environment. It replaces a stale environment already present in local config.
- Tokens live in the OS keychain only. `--no-input` + login: the device flow still needs the user to visit the URL — surface the URL and code to the user (in their language), then `wathba auth complete` / re-check `auth status`.
- Exit 3 anywhere later → session expired → `auth refresh`, else `login --device` again.

### Workspace-agent onboarding

When the agent needs to inspect the member's projects and capabilities and
perform governed member operations, request the exact workspace profile:

```sh
wathba login --device --access workspace --wait --json
wathba auth status --json
wathba workspace show --json --no-input
wathba capability catalog --json --no-input
wathba capability list --project <projectId> --environment <environmentId> --json --no-input
```

The member approves one named, versioned profile in the Wathba portal. The CLI
stores the resulting session only in the OS keychain and rejects `--token` and
`WATHBA_TOKEN` for workspace commands. `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` means stop and
ask for profile approval; never construct a broader scope list. A backend `403`
is authoritative. Project runtime execution is a different trust domain and
requires a separate project API key.

## 2. Service lifecycle (platform-side on/off)

```sh
wathba service list --json                       # find serviceCode; exact workspace keychain session
wathba service setup <svc> --json
```
Branch on outcome:
- `SETUP_NOT_REQUIRED` → `wathba service activate <svc> --json` directly.
- `PENDING` → `wathba service wait <svc> --until ready --json` (blocks; respects `--timeout`), or poll `service status`.
- `ACTION_REQUIRED` → `wathba service open <svc> --json --no-input` gives the exact channel-validated Wathba setup URL with selected `environmentId`; hand it to the user, then re-check `status`.
- `READY_TO_ACTIVATE` / `canActivate: true` → `wathba service activate <svc> --json`.
Finish: `wathba service status <svc> --json` must show `ACTIVE` before you tell the user it's done.

Deactivation: `service deactivate` → outcome `DEACTIVATION_PENDING` → `service wait <svc> --until removed --json` → `REMOVED`. This is also the canonical capability-removal flow for workspace agents; direct pin removal is legacy browser-fresh and interactive-only.

### Torod setup and safe recovery

`logistics.shipping` maps to `shipping.torod`. Current setup authority is
`shipping.torod.v2` version 2 with exactly these four gates:

- `torod_account_connected`
- `torod_reference_data_fresh`
- `torod_pickup_address_active`
- `torod_wallet_funded`

Historical `shipping.torod.v1` bindings may be read but never mutated or
activated by this CLI release. A current v2 projection must contain exactly
those four facts;
missing, extra, or webhook-substituted readiness is a protocol failure.

In the `wathba.output.v1` success envelope, use only these stable status paths:

- `data.activationPolicy.setupFlowCode`
- `data.activationPolicy.setupFlowVersion`
- `data.setup.requirements[]`, with each gate's `code`, `status`, `owner`, and
  `blocking`

For current Torod, the authority paths must be `shipping.torod.v2` and `2`, and
the requirement-code set must be exactly the four gates above. If the authority
paths instead report `shipping.torod.v1` and `1`, keep the command status-only:
do not run `setup`, `activate`, or `reconcile`. The CLI manifest contains no
v1-to-v2 migration command, so report the blocked mutation and do not invent a
replacement command. Deactivation remains a separate member-requested cleanup
lifecycle and is not a migration path.

New Torod registration (install-plugin) and existing-account login are done in
the Wathba setup page. The member—not the agent—enters any Torod password,
address/contact data, or wallet funding details. Wathba handles the provider
outcomes exactly:

- install-plugin `status: true`, code `200`: seal the returned plugin
  credentials server-side before completing `torod_account_connected`; Torod
  emails the member's Torod email and generated password.
- install-plugin code `422` with `email: "E-Mail already exist"`: offer
  existing-account login and do not retry registration or create duplicate
  data.
- login-plugin `status: true`, code `200`: seal the returned credential bundle
  server-side before completing the account gate.
- login-plugin code `406` with `"The email or password isn't correct"`: keep
  the gate incomplete and show one generic invalid-credentials portal error.

Never request, repeat, persist, log, or expose any password, raw plugin
response, `client_id`, or `client_secret_key` through the CLI or agent.

For a connected setup stalled on safe observation only:

```sh
wathba service reconcile shipping.torod --target references --idempotency-key idem_... --json --no-input
wathba service reconcile shipping.torod --target wallet --idempotency-key idem_... --json --no-input
```

Reuse the key only when retrying the exact same context, target, and request.
The CLI persists that binding before the POST; changed intent fails locally and
a later independent refresh needs a new key. Each command sends the selected
environment, discards the provider response, and returns normalized generic
setup status. Install, login, address, and funding targets are invalid and make
no request. The explicit key must be 1–255 characters and match
`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:-]{0,254}`; use a new unique opaque value for each
independent refresh.

## 3. Capability integration (writes into the user's app)

Precondition: keychain device session (`integrate` rejects `--token`/`WATHBA_TOKEN`), and run from (or `--project-dir`) the app repo.

```sh
wathba integrate <capabilityCode> --project-dir . --credential-destination local_mock --json --no-input
```
Internally: local preflight/pins → setup start/status → guarded activation → owner actions → signed skill install + member-app patch → verification. It stops at typed pause points:
- Member-owned `ACTION_REQUIRED` / `BLOCKED` → the output includes the exact context-bound `wathba service open ... --json --no-input` next command. Run it, give the Wathba URL to the member, then after completion:
```sh
wathba integrate resume <capabilityCode> --json --no-input
```
- `PENDING` stays observational; follow the returned wait/status/resume command and never invent progress.
Repeat resume until terminal. Then verify:
```sh
wathba integrate verify <capabilityCode> --json    # exit 9 = verification failed → integrate repair
wathba capability verify <capabilityCode> --json
```
Maintenance: `integrate upgrade` (may need `--acknowledge-migration-digest`), `integrate rollback`, `integrate remove`.

The signed install is fail-closed. Catalog 007 skill `1.0.6` must carry the
`wathba.sha256-digest.v1` publisher-signature payload format on its canonical
manifest and artifacts; the CLI independently verifies the domain-separated
signature frame, exact content digest, trust chain, and revocation state.
Never bypass a format/signature failure or substitute a local bundle. Legacy
signatures without the field keep exact-byte verification only for the
canonical internal-preview-001 identity and matching MVP 001-006 release
identities. Unknown, renamed, mismatched, and later identities require digest
framing and fail closed if it is absent.

For a governed destination instead of `local_mock`, set
`--credential-destination` to a capability-supported kind and omit
`--credential-destination-id` on the first run. The CLI inventories the exact
project/environment and selects one currently certified destination. If more
than one is ready, branch only on the exact
`data.setupAction.destinations[].selectCommand` values it returns. If none is
ready, remain `BLOCKED`; never guess an ID. Use the strict read-only
`listCredentialDestinations`/`getCredentialDestination` diagnostic recipe in
`references/commands.md` when the inventory needs inspection.

## 4. Journal & locking semantics

- Integration state: `$(UserConfigDir)/wathba/integrations` (schema `wathba.integration-journal.v1`/`.v2`). Service onboarding state: `$(UserConfigDir)/wathba/service-onboarding`. Project projection: `.wathba/integration.lock` (commit-worthy).
- Exit 8 (`CONFLICT_OR_REPLAY_MISMATCH`) = another process advanced the journal. Do NOT retry the same command blindly — run `integrate status <cap> --json` (or `service status`) and continue from the reported state.
- Use `--idempotency-key` on mutations you might have to retry (network flakes).

## 5. API keys

```sh
wathba key create --environment <env> --json     # or --env test for a test key
wathba key list --json
wathba key rotate <keyId> --overlap-seconds 300 --json   # overlap keeps old key valid during cutover
wathba key activation complete <keyId> --json
```
Incident response: `key suspend` (temporary) · `key revoke` (permanent) · `key compromise <keyId>` (report + kill) · `key reactivate` (undo suspend). Key and activation-secret values remain redacted and agent-invisible; never ask the user to paste them into chat. Use a governed credential destination or protected portal handoff.

## 6. Self-update

```sh
wathba update check --json
wathba self-update --json                    # stable channel
wathba self-update --channel beta --json
wathba self-update --verify-only --json      # verify current install
wathba self-update --rollback --json         # after a bad update (exit 10)
```

## 7. Raw API escape hatch

When no dedicated command exists:
```sh
wathba api operations --json
wathba schema get <operationId> --json       # learn the input shape
wathba api call <operationId> --input payload.json --json
```

## Reporting back to the user

Summarize: what was requested → commands run → final `outcome` per service/capability → anything still pending and exactly what the user must do next. In the user's language (see `arabic-glossary.md` for Arabic responses). Never claim ACTIVE/installed without having seen it in JSON output.
