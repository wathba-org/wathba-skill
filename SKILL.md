# Wathba CLI

Use `wathba` as the agent interface to Wathba. Respond in the user's language;
keep commands, IDs, codes, URLs, and JSON fields in Latin script.

## Core safety rules

1. Use `--json` and normally `--no-input`. Parse the envelope; do not scrape
   human help text.
2. Inspect the typed outcome as well as the exit code.
3. Never ask for, receive, print, store, or paste a project API key, provider
   credential, password, cookie, signing secret, raw card data, protected
   document, funding detail, or raw provider payload.
4. Never invent a provider route or operation. Use `wathba manifest --json`,
   `wathba api operations --json`, and the verified signed service manifest.
5. Service onboarding is operator-owned for the MVP. Provider credentials and
   readiness stay operator-owned; do not search for or invent member `setup`,
   `open`, `reconcile`, `activate`, or `deactivate` commands.
   Do not run `service integrate` for `domains.souq-t2` until it appears in the
   signed service inventory. Domain read/preview commands remain control-plane
   operations; availability is never purchase authority, mutation approval, or
   provider readiness.
6. Treat `wathba service list --json --no-input` as the only current service
   inventory. Named services in these bundled references are integration
   examples, not availability claims. If a service is absent, do not advertise,
   inspect, install, or integrate it; treat a direct not-found response the same
   way.
7. Treat `KEYRING_UNAVAILABLE` as a local credential-store infrastructure
   failure and stop. Never create a plaintext fallback, never suggest
   `WATHBA_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER=file`, and never start daemons or modify the
   member's shell automatically.
8. Prefer the governed MCP/CLI agent workspace for repository recommendation,
   project facts, and pinned integration guidance. It must never receive or
   return a test key, live key, or provider credential. Project creation is an
   explicit, idempotent sandbox-only action; production environments, keys, and
   production approval remain human portal actions.
9. Treat `apiContractVersion` on the selected service binding as immutable
   integration input. Never substitute the catalog default or newest version,
   and never upgrade it as part of an ordinary CLI, SDK, capability, provider,
   or production release. Send the exact pin as `Wathba-Version` on member-app
   runtime calls and fail closed if the response version differs.

## Installation

Prefer the official zero-dependency npm package; fall back to the native
installer scripts only when npm (Node.js 18.18+) is unavailable or the npm
install fails. Do not use Homebrew or customer GitHub Release assets directly:

```sh
# Preferred: npm on macOS, Linux, or Windows (Node.js 18.18+)
npm install --global @wathba-cli/cli
```

```sh
# Fallback: macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://install.wathba.info/install.sh | bash

# Fallback: Windows PowerShell
irm https://install.wathba.info/install.ps1 | iex
```

The native installer writes the binary to `$HOME/.wathba/bin` and installs this
skill plus the signed `wathba-integration` bootstrap skill. npm installs the
same authenticated native binary inside `@wathba-cli/cli`, exposes `wathba`,
and intentionally does not write agent skills outside the package. For npm,
install them explicitly when needed:

```sh
wathba skill agent install --json --no-input
wathba skill bootstrap install --json --no-input
```

Pin a native channel or version with `WATHBA_CHANNEL=beta` or
`WATHBA_VERSION=v1.4.0`; use `@beta` or an exact npm version for npm.

Always bring the CLI to the latest release after a first install, and again
before using its MCP guidance: run `wathba update check --json`, and if an
update is available, apply it with the method that owns the install — `npm
install --global @wathba-cli/cli@latest` for npm-managed installs, `wathba
self-update` for native installs (`wathba self-update` refuses npm-managed
installs). Both installation paths verify signed artifacts; never bypass
verification. Then run:

```sh
hash -r
if ! command -v wathba >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.wathba/bin"
fi
if command -v which >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  which -a wathba
else
  command -v wathba
fi
wathba version --json
wathba doctor --json
```

Never prepend `$HOME/.wathba/bin` after an npm installation: that can shadow a
newer npm-managed CLI with an older native binary. `doctor` reports the
shell-selected executable and warns when another Wathba installation may be
shadowed.

## Authenticate and select context

When a portal-generated prompt supplies a pairing code, run:

```sh
wathba login --pairing-code <code> --wait --no-input --json
wathba auth status --json
wathba workspace show --json --no-input
wathba project select <projectId> --environment <environmentId> --json
```

Tell the member to approve the computer on the Wathba page they already have
open. Do not relay an approval URL or user code, and do not run `wathba auth
complete`; the bound login waits for approval and stores the tokens itself.

When no pairing code is supplied, use the manual fallback:

```sh
wathba login --no-input --json
# After the member approves the code in Wathba:
wathba auth complete --no-input --json
wathba auth status --json
wathba workspace show --json --no-input
wathba project select <projectId> --environment <environmentId> --json
```

The backend assigns the fixed `member_workspace.v4` profile; login never accepts
raw scopes or a selectable profile. Tokens stay in the OS keychain. Workspace
commands reject `--token` and `WATHBA_TOKEN`. MCP uses a separate OAuth
authorization flow and the narrow `mcp:read` scope. In a manual agent run
without a pairing code, present the safe approval URL and code to the member,
then use `wathba auth complete --no-input --json` after approval.

Before login, require a successful `wathba doctor --json`. On Linux, the same
persistent D-Bus user session, Secret Service provider, and accessible unlocked
login/default collection must survive `login`, approval, `auth complete`, and
later commands; do not create a fresh `dbus-run-session` for each command.
Windows uses native Credential Manager and macOS uses native Keychain, with no
Linux desktop requirement. `KEYRING_UNAVAILABLE` means that infrastructure is
not usable; `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` means it is usable but no valid Wathba session
exists.

If `workspace show` returns no project, do not invent an ID or leave the CLI
workflow. Build a bounded recommendation first, then create one sandbox project
explicitly with a stable idempotency key:

```sh
wathba service recommend --project-dir . --json --no-input
wathba project create --name <name> --repository-profile-digest <digest> --idempotency-key <stable-key> --json --no-input
```

## Service enablement

First read the live service inventory. Wathba backoffice operators complete
provider onboarding and enable services returned there:

- Historical Authenta (`messaging.otp.authenta`) and Torod: operator enablement
  is member-wide. This does not activate the new Authentica reseller service.
- Authentica reseller (`messaging.otp.authentica`): the member configures the
  selected project and environment in the portal. Its provider application is
  linked to that exact scope; another project's setup is not sufficient.
- Moyasar-backed payments: enable separately for each project.

Managed OTP (`messaging.otp.wathba`) remains the default for `messaging.otp`.
Never substitute it or historical Authenta when Authentica reseller is requested.
Follow [the Authentica integration boundary](references/authentica.md) and the
selected service's live, pinned guidance. An absent service is unavailable.

The member/agent commands are read-only:

```sh
wathba service list --project <projectId> --json --no-input
wathba service status <serviceCode> --project <projectId> --environment <environmentId> --json --no-input
wathba service wait <serviceCode> --until enabled --project <projectId> --environment <environmentId> --json --no-input
wathba service skill <serviceCode> --project <projectId> --json --no-input
wathba service recommend --project-dir . --project <projectId> --json --no-input
```

If the live inventory contains the service but it is not enabled, report the
returned operator or project-portal action. Authentica status reads only its
exact project/environment binding and reports `runtimeReadiness: unchecked`;
an active binding does not replace provider, funding or signed-bundle checks.
Status and wait never mutate provider state.

## Use the hosted MCP

```sh
wathba mcp --api-url https://api.wathba.info --json
```

The command prints deterministic setup for Replit, Claude Code, Codex, MCP
Inspector, and any remote-MCP host. Authorize the host in the browser with the
narrow `mcp:read` scope. The base grant exposes exactly eight tools:

- `list_projects`
- `get_project_setup`
- `list_project_services`
- `get_service_integration_docs`
- `get_service_operations`
- `get_service_troubleshooting`
- `recommend_services_for_repository`
- `create_project`

The first seven tools are read-only. `create_project` requires separately
approved `projects:create`, a stable idempotency key, and creates only one
project plus one active sandbox. Never request that scope when a project
already exists. Recommendation never enables a service.

Domain management is a separate, opt-in MCP profile. Do not request it during
ordinary integration setup. When the member explicitly asks for it, use the
least-privilege command printed in `domainManagement.commands`:

- `mcp:domains:read` adds domain, DNS-zone, name-server, preview, and action
  reads.
- `mcp:domains:dns:request` adds only `request_domain_dns_change` and requires
  the domain read scope.
- `mcp:domains:nameservers:request` adds only
  `request_domain_nameserver_change` and requires the domain read scope.

The two request tools create immutable `approval_pending` actions only. They
never approve or dispatch a provider change; the member reviews the exact diff
in the portal. MCP never registers or purchases a domain, accepts legal terms,
or handles registrant identity data.

The base resource templates are `wathba://projects/{projectId}/setup`,
`wathba://projects/{projectId}/services/{serviceCode}/integration`, and
`wathba://projects/{projectId}/services/{serviceCode}/operations`. The domain
read grant adds the three templates listed in `domainManagement.resourceTemplates`.
Use the pinned facts returned by the tools; never infer a service, skill,
operation, or production status.

## Detect and integrate the repository

```sh
wathba integrate inspect --project-dir . --json --no-input
wathba service recommend --project-dir . --json --no-input
wathba integrate <capabilityCode> --project-dir . --project <projectId> --environment <environmentId> --json --no-input
```

Inspection is local and read-only. Recommendation sends only the strict,
bounded, auditable `RepositoryProfileV1`: dependency identifiers, allowlisted
feature signals, architecture booleans, and environment-variable names. It
never sends source, file contents, absolute paths, `.env` values, credentials,
git data, or archives, and it never enables a service.

`integrate` retrieves and strictly validates the same
`AgentIntegrationBundleV2` used by MCP, checks every project/environment/
service/capability/artifact pin, and installs the exact trusted skill by
default. It never patches member application code, uploads the repository,
executes a runtime operation, or tracks progress. Use `--no-install-skill` to
preview the signed install command without writing a skill.

Detection covers TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, PHP, .NET,
cURL-oriented, and unknown repositories. Follow only the bundle's exact signed
recipe or verified HTTP projection. Inspect runtime operations with `wathba
capability operations`, validate a local JSON envelope with `wathba capability
validate`, and run effect-free contract verification with:

```sh
wathba capability api-contract inspect <serviceCode> \
  --project <projectId> --environment <environmentId> --json --no-input
```

The binding-owned contract is the source of truth for generated runtime code.
An upgrade is a separate member decision. In a sandbox environment, first run
the target fixture and record its exact published digest, then create evidence
and perform the compare-and-swap upgrade:

```sh
wathba capability api-contract preview <serviceCode> --target <version> \
  --fixture-digest <sha256:digest> --project <projectId> \
  --environment <sandboxEnvironmentId> --idempotency-key <key> --json --no-input
wathba capability api-contract upgrade <serviceCode> --target <version> \
  --binding-version <ownerVersion> --evidence <verificationEvidenceRef> \
  --project <projectId> --environment <sandboxEnvironmentId> \
  --idempotency-key <key> --json --no-input
```

Roll a sandbox binding back to the immediate prior version with `wathba
capability api-contract rollback <serviceCode> --target <priorVersion>
--binding-version <ownerVersion> ...`; rollback needs no evidence. Each
`supportedTargets` entry from `inspect` states its `changeKind` (`upgrade` or
`rollback`). An unknown target fails with `api_contract_version_unknown`; do
not retry with a different version.

For production upgrades, use the delegated `plan`, `prepare`, `apply`, and
`recover` commands described in [project compatibility](references/project-compatibility.md).
Test both app versions and retain a deployable fallback before preparing the
plan. Explain the exact update and live-app risk, then obtain explicit member
confirmation in the conversation. The authenticated agent attests that
confirmation; there is no second portal approval. Existing sessions do not gain
upgrade permission automatically. Never fabricate confirmation or retry an
ambiguous financial operation with a different version or idempotency key.

Run effect-free contract verification with:

```sh
wathba capability verify <capabilityCode> --mode contract --project <projectId> --environment <environmentId> --idempotency-key <stable-key> --json --no-input
```

Sandbox verification causes a bounded real provider effect and therefore also
requires `--accept-provider-effect`. Patch and test the member application with
its normal tools; Wathba does not claim a local `READY` state.

Ignore legacy `.wathba/integration.lock` and `.wathba/integration.json`
contents. To list them without deletion:

```sh
wathba integrate cleanup --project-dir . --json --no-input
```

After local tests pass, explain the portal handoff. The member creates the
production environment, obtains required approval, creates the test or live API
key, and puts it directly into the trusted server-side secret store. The agent
must not ask the member to paste that key.

## Runtime and API keys

Runtime operations execute from the member application's trusted server with a
separate project/environment API key. An authorized human creates and reveals
that key once at `/app/projects/<projectId>/keys` and configures it directly on
the server outside the agent's view.

The fixed workspace profile includes `keys:read` and intentionally excludes
`keys:manage`. An agent may use only `wathba key list --project <projectId>
--json` for safe metadata. Key creation, rotation, revocation, suspension,
reactivation, and compromise handling are protected portal actions. A workspace
agent must not invoke them or seek a broader token.

The runtime path is member app → Wathba → server-side provider credential →
provider → normalized response. The agent never calls the provider directly.

## Member domains

Domain registration, legal-profile entry, search, purchase confirmation, and
approval live in the member portal. They are control-plane operations, so do
not run `wathba integrate domains.management` and never ask for a national ID,
CR number, supporting document, provider credential, or payment detail.

The CLI can read the member-owned domain portfolio and subscription metadata,
optionally filter the portfolio by project, and read normalized DNS/name-server
state. It may preview and request one exact DNS record change or one exact
name-server replacement. A request returns `outcome: approval_required`, an
immutable action reference, and the canonical member-portal URL. It is not
provider success. Use the bounded `wathba domain action wait` or
`wathba domain action get`; never claim completion until the action reports
`succeeded`.

Every mutation requires the active attribution project and exact attachment
version. The CLI cannot attach a domain, fund a wallet, accept Saudi terms,
confirm a purchase, renew, or change auto-renew.

`wathba domain open` is a credential-free handoff to the member portal. It
never embeds acceptance, purchase, approval, or wallet authority.

Use `references/domains.md` for the complete file shapes, preview/request
sequence, idempotency rule, and portal handoff.

## Torod

Only when the live inventory contains `shipping.torod`, Torod is
operator-enabled once per member. The CLI has no Torod login, plugin,
address, readiness-refresh, wallet-facts, funding-link, or wallet-funding flow.
Funding remains between the member and Torod through Torod's operation.

All Wathba-supported Torod runtime operations come from the signed service
manifest. If a runtime result is pending or ambiguous, poll the same Wathba
execution; do not issue a duplicate shipment as a probe.

## Webhooks

Webhooks are retained. The member configures a Wathba delivery endpoint and
subscriptions. Wathba registers supported provider webhooks using server-held
credentials, verifies inbound callbacks, deduplicates and normalizes them, and
delivers signed member events. Never request a provider webhook secret.

Manage member endpoints with `wathba webhook register|list|verify|disable`
and inspect delivery status with `wathba webhook deliveries`. The endpoint
signing secret is portal-only; the CLI always redacts it. Follow
`references/webhooks.md` for registration, signature verification,
deduplication, and authoritative state confirmation.

## Troubleshooting

- Authentication required: run `wathba login --no-input --json`, ask the member
  to approve it, then run `wathba auth complete --no-input --json`.
- Disabled service: report whether the Wathba operator must enable it for the
  member or selected project; optionally use `service wait --until enabled`.
- Repository mismatch: run `wathba integrate inspect --project-dir . --json
  --no-input`, then `wathba service recommend --project-dir . --json
  --no-input`; stop on an ambiguous target or stack.
- Protocol/signature failure: stop. Do not bypass verification.
- Unknown command or flag: inspect `wathba manifest --json` or command help.
- Wathba bug or unresolvable blocker: stop and tell the member what failed
  and why, then offer to report it to Wathba. Prepare a sanitized,
  member-safe summary with no secrets, tokens, or customer data.
  Agent-submitted feedback is consent-gated: a human must grant standing
  consent at an interactive terminal first, and without that consent the
  member reviews and sends the report themselves with `wathba feedback`.

For API upgrades, follow `references/project-compatibility.md`. Use the delegated

risk, preserve and test the previous app implementation, and obtain one explicit
member confirmation for the exact plan in the conversation. Never manufacture
`--member-confirmed`; no second portal approval is required for this flow.
